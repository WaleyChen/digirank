- how to price using both criteria?

1. hook up buttons to controller action, button unclick controller logic
2. modify search result template to show repetitions and unique digit count
3. bold repetitions, and colour the different fonts

4. change the pricing, have an algorithm for pricing

normalize the fonts
include bootstrap and add bubbles
score for unique digit count and lowest repeition %

colour the numbers

spin up heroku instance
copy data to production
less records in production since there are too many records
have bubbles describing the repetition percentage and unique digit count?

fix the buy button

TODO
- fix buy button numbers

- add a $$$ button
    - other buttons turn off when $$$ button is pressed
